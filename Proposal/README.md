<h1>Project Proposal</h1>
<h2>Project Name: Bracketeer</h2>


<h3>What is the Problem?</h3>
<p>Many competitive events (such as fighting games, chess tournaments, etc), use tournament-style bracket systems for tracking the progress of competitors. Many bracket managing systems exist online so that tournament participants can view brackets, and tournament organizers can update them as the event progresses. It is common for participants at in-person events to access these sites via mobile browsers, however, many tournament managing sites are not designed for mobile, and as a result it can be cumbersome to find and track your individual progress in a bracket. Internet issues arising can also be a problem at these events, making these sites difficult to access. Our PWA will help solve this issue by providing a mobile-friendly bracket management system so that tournament participants can track their progress at in-person events with ease. Additionally, our PWA will provide tournament organizers a simple way to set up a bracket, add participants, and update tournament progress over the course of an event.</p>
