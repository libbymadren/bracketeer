<h1>Project Proposal: Bracketeer</h1>

<h2>What Is The Problem?</h2>
<p>Many competitive events (such as fighting games, chess tournaments, etc), use tournament-style bracket systems for tracking the progress of competitors. Many bracket managing systems exist online so that tournament participants can view brackets, and tournament organizers can update them as the event progresses. It is common for participants at in-person events to access these sites via mobile browsers, however, many tournament managing sites are not designed for mobile, and as a result it can be cumbersome to find and track your individual progress in a bracket. Internet issues arising can also be a problem at these events, making these sites difficult to access. Bracketeer, our PWA will help solve this issue by providing a mobile-friendly bracket management system so that tournament participants can track their progress at in-person events with ease. Additionally, our PWA will provide tournament organizers a simple way to set up a bracket, add participants, and update tournament progress over the course of an event.</p>

<h2>General Features</h2>

There are two main types of users to consider - the tournament organizer (TO) who creates and runs brackets, and the participant who is viewing the bracket. A TO needs an account to access features specific to them, while a participant can access features with or without an account. TO-specific features are marked as such in the feature list below.

<h2>Team Contributions</h2>
<p>After agreeing on an initial idea of a mobile-friendly bracket managing system, each team member took some time to indvidually come up with ideas
for what kinds of features this product should have. We shared our indvidual ideas over Discord, and then met as a group to discuss. Once we
synthesized our ideas into an agreed upon feature list, we then split up the list into core features, additional features, and stretch goals. 
From there, we worked on wireframes as a group in order to ensure we were all on the same page with how the product will roughly look.

Libby was responsible for the writeup of the problem statement, Nathan was responsbible for the organization of the feature list and data, and Jack was responsible for the assembly of the wireframes. However, we discussed each of these as a group and we all contributed in each area.
  
In the future, we plan to divide work between team members after we come up with a more formal set of requirements for the project.
